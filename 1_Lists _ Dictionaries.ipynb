Instructions (whether they are defined in a free code, in a if statement or in a loop while or for) are always  executed on objects. Variables as discussed before represent a particular type of objects in python. But in a general way, instructions in a python program are defined from a collection of objects which comes in different forms of sequences of values. These sequences of values can be made for example by a set of variables with unique value. That finally means that a variable defined from a single value is not generally sufficient to form the architecture of a program.
